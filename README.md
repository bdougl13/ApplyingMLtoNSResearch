# ApplyingMLtoNSResearch
This is just a project that extends the Graduate Physics Research I did at Texas A&M Commerce. 
Just wanted to publish this for employers to see the work I am capable of as far as programming, statistical analysis, and data science.
This is a self-created project, and not for any commerical use or anything like that. Just doing out of interest and self-improvement :)

Machine learning techniques incorporated include linear regression and K-Means Clustering. Other ML techniques learned and shown in the FinalProjectAssignment.ipynb include Decision trees, Random Forest, K-fold cross validation, Naive-Bayes, and SVM/SVC.
Also learned from the Deep Learning/ Neural Networks course and included the final project on that as well.
